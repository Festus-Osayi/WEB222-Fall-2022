          <sup>1</sup> From May through October, Centre Island's attractions are accessible.
          <sup>2</sup> The island transforms back into a quiet residential neighbourhood throughout
          the winter. Additionally, The boat runs all year round, however it runs more frequently in
          the busy summer months and Visitors are free to go year-round, but there isn't a lot to do
          when the attractions are closed down. That does not means it can't be an enjoyable trip.

          cost. In addition, the island neighborhoods are attractive and make for an enjoyable walk
          around. Fall colors can be glorious and crowds are almost non-existent.
